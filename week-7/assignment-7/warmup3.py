# Warmup 3: Use the os Module
# Write a single script that does all three of the following:

# Print your current working directory using os.getcwd().
# Check whether ../data/expenses.csv exists using os.path.exists(). 
# Print "expenses.csv found." or "expenses.csv not found." accordingly.
# Use os.path.join() to build the path "../data/expenses.csv" from its parts ("..", "data", "expenses.csv") and print the result.

import os

print(os.getcwd())
if os.path.exists("../data/expenses.csv"):
    print("expenses.csv found.")
else:
    print("expenses.csv not found.")

path = os.path.join("..", "data", "expenses.csv")
print(path)
